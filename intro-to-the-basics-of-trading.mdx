<Warning>
Capital preservation is the foundation of long-term success. Without a 'staying power' mindset, emotional traps like revenge trading become inevitable. We often see meteoric rises—like a portfolio surging from 88k -> 4.3M — followed by a total collapse. This happens when risk is increased exponentially rather than managed strategically. When you grow without diversifying, you aren't just building a portfolio; you're building a tower without a foundation.

## Overview

```Markets are comprised of buyers and sellers. It's defined by the interaction of both buyers (demand) and sellers (supply). Without both, you can't reach a transaction or exchange which is the heart of what the market is. The oversimplified version the average person thinks of is simply buying a stock, waiting for it to get to a certain price point then selling even in this simple example there is someone on the other side when the investor buys the stock as someone had to sell to them and when the investor sold someone had to be on the other side to buy. The point where both buyer and seller agree on price is the equilibrium but the market provides more opportunities far more complex than what the average person understands.```

<Warning>To put things into perspective, a 50% gain in a stock is not the same as 50% down in a stock. If you have shares that moved 50% up from \$100 then you would have \$150. If it now falls by 50%, you have \$75.</Warning>
