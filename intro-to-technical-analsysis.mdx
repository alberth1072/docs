## What is Technical Analysis?

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Technical analysis is the study of price action and market patterns.

<Warning>
Technical analysis should be used in conjunction with other forms of analysis. Past performance does not guarantee future results.
</Warning>

## Core Principles

### Price Action

**Price action** refers to the movement of a security's price plotted over time. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

- Price reflects all available information
- Prices move in trends
- History tends to repeat itself

### Chart Patterns

Chart patterns are recognizable shapes that form on price charts. These patterns can indicate potential future price movements.

#### Common Patterns

1. **Head and Shoulders**: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit
2. **Double Top/Bottom**: Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore
3. **Triangle Patterns**: Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit

## Technical Indicators

Technical indicators are mathematical calculations based on price, volume, or open interest. They help traders identify trends and potential entry/exit points.

### Trend Indicators

| Indicator | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Moving Average | Shows average price over time | 50-day, 200-day MA |
| MACD | Measures momentum | Convergence/divergence |
| ADX | Measures trend strength | Values above 25 indicate strong trend |

### Oscillators

Oscillators help identify overbought or oversold conditions:

- **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: Ranges from 0 to 100
- **Stochastic Oscillator**: Compares closing price to price range
- **CCI (Commodity Channel Index)**: Measures price deviation

## Reading Charts

### Timeframes

Different timeframes serve different purposes:

- **1-minute to 15-minute**: Scalping and short-term trading
- **1-hour to 4-hour**: Day trading and swing trading
- **Daily to Weekly**: Position trading and long-term analysis

### Volume Analysis

Volume is a crucial component of technical analysis. High volume often confirms price movements, while low volume may indicate weak moves.

<Tip>
Always look at volume alongside price action. A price move with low volume is less reliable than one with high volume.
</Tip>

## Building Your Analysis

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Identify the Trend**: Determine if the market is trending up, down, or sideways
2. **Find Support/Resistance**: Locate key price levels
3. **Apply Indicators**: Use technical indicators to confirm your analysis
4. **Look for Patterns**: Identify chart patterns that may indicate future movement
5. **Confirm with Volume**: Verify your analysis with volume data
